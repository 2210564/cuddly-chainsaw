My Project: MY Personal Portfolio website

Description:
->I've used Html , CSS and JavaScript in this project.

->I used VsCode for writing and executing all my project code stuff as its more friendly for the beginner to use.

->I've used font awesome website to add up the free icons required.

->For background , logo etc i've used unsplash to download free images.

->I used media query in this project to make it responsive for the smaller screens , example for width and height of the viewport etc.

->I used some mouse events like onclick to click an element and get shown a required section like for example if we click oon about we will be automatically taken down to the about section in my portfolio.

->I added all the required elements in my portfolio like skills education and experience, i also added my hobbies in that added some icons for each of it and just kept it simple without any margins and other stuff..so that it look more attractive and simple.

->And finally i added a download option to download my resume although ive not filled it yet..
so this is all about my project.

* I've faced some problems while adding up a google sheet for the contact form so as to let me know if someone uses and send me a message but unfortunately my bad its failed but ill make sure to add up that contact form asap in the future.
